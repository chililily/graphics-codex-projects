## Report

### Implementation
<!--
    Describe the main algorithms of your program, using pseudocode or diagrams as appropriate. 

    Summarize your implementation design in no more than two paragraphs. Provide sufficient information to aid future implementors seeking to reproduce your work. Why did you make the program this way? What were your main iteration structures? What were the key G3D routines that you used? 
-->

### Results
<!--
   Demonstrate that your program is functioning correctly by showing clear pictures of each of the shapes with the wireframe visible. For the heightfield, show the source image as well. Examples are given below. 

    Show one or more images of your demo scene (without wireframe). Describe it in a single paragraph, indicating both what it is and how you approached the construction. You must feature a mesh generated by your program, but can augment the scene with other models if you wish.

**Unit cube**

Axis-aligned unit cube centered at origin, coloured blue to help distinguish it from the background.

### Discussion
<!--
       Describe what you learned while working on this project. Distinguish software engineering, algorithmic, and mathematical skills. Include the reading and ideas that you had to implicitly work through even if not required.  
-->

### Questions
<!--
   Answer these questions in at most three sentences each 
-->
1. G3D uses some real-time rendering tricks to fake reflections of the sky, but if you fly along the shore of my island, you'll see that the water doesn't actually reflect the mountains. How could you simulate the image of the missing reflection in a plane of water or a mirror using only nonreflective 3D models?

Use a transformed version of the image used for the sky as a texture on the appropriate part of the model.

2. The underlying renderer converts all models into triangles, which you can see in the wireframe renderings. Why are triangle meshes the preferred primitive compared to, say, quadrilaterals, which would be more space efficient and are often easier for modeling?

3. The regular tessellation we used for heightfields is inefficient. It will allocate the same number of triangles for flat portions of the heightfield that need few triangles as for very hilly ones that need many to accurately represent the shape. Propose an alternative algorithm for computing a more efficient triangular tessellation for a given heightfield. Do not actually implement your algorithm. You may invent one on your own or use external resources to discover existing algorithms.

### Workflow
<!--
    Make a table planning major tasks for this project and then recording your planned and actual time on them, as show in Table 1. Each task should be between 0.5 and 1.5 planned hours. Roll up smaller ones and break down longer ones. Break each task directly corresponding to a deliverable into three versions: a complete first draft, a minimum viable product, and the polished version. Infrastructure tasks that are necessary precursors for others can remain as a single version. 

    How long did the project take you, from start to finish (excluding time spent reading, including time writing the report)? Distinguish time to the minimum viable product vs. polishing time. Report this as two numbers, in hours.
