**Day work time**: 30m

**Total work time**: 4h30m

Worked on testing `OFFdata::write`. Linker issue with `OFFdata.cpp`; as an easy solution I simply added the `.cpp` file to project `Tests`. Might be resolved through fiddling with include directories.

Resolved linker error: add property sheet (View > Other Windows > Property Manager) `developer-build-paths.props` (g3d\G3D10\Visual Studio\props`) to projects that depend on `G3D`.

Worked on testing for `OFFdata`.

Finished writing first draft of `OFFdata` class. Set up unit testing, but having some trouble linking `G3D` library in unit testing project.

Drafted report and completed unit cube task.

The unit cube task took longer than expected due to my incorrectly assuming a counterclockwise vertex winding order when the program instead seems to use a clockwise winding order (compounded by some miscellaneous confusions before I realized what the issue was).
