=====================================================
**Day work time**: 45m

**Total work time**: 8h30m

Added heightfield GUI pane. Initial draft would crash the app due to incorrect initializing of `m_heightfieldSettings`.

**Next time**: Work on heightfield generation from image: convert to grayscale; add vertex with calculated position (XZ image coordinates, Y from grayscale value of pixel); iterate through vertices and connect to make faces (two triangles per quad of vertices).

Display a message on screen while generating and then flush the `G3D::ArticulatedModel` cache, and reload the current scene on completion.

Tested and fixed `saveOFF`. Added results to report. Axed workflow section of report.

**Next time**: Write a procedure that generates a regular heightfield in `data-files/model/heightfield.off` with elevation given by the grayscale values of an image file. Use a file dialog to select the file, a number box to scale the x and z integer coordinates by, and a number box to set the scale that 1.0 corresponds to for height. Make a button labelled “Generate” that launches the generator. Display a message on screen while generating and then flush the `G3D::ArticulatedModel` cache, and reload the current scene on completion.

**Total work time**: 7h15m

Wrote function to save cylinder model to OFF file (`App::saveOFF`).

**Next time**: Test `App::saveOFF` and get rid of `OFFData` class stuff once working. Add to report.

2022-01-23:
=====================================================
**Day work time**: 2h15m

**Total work time**: 6h45m

Finished writing functions that add a cylinder model to a scene (`App::addCylinderToScene`).

**Next time**: write `makeCylinder` to invoke `App::addCylinderToScene` (move `makeCylinder` into `App` class) and convert from model to OFF file.

=====================================================
**Day work time**: 30m

**Total work time**: 4h30m

Worked on testing `OFFdata::write`. Linker issue with `OFFdata.cpp`; as an easy solution I simply added the `.cpp` file to project `Tests`. Might be resolved through fiddling with include directories.

2021-11-07: 
=====================================================
**Day work time**: 1h

**Total work time**: 4h

Resolved linker error: add property sheet (View > Other Windows > Property Manager) `developer-build-paths.props` (g3d\G3D10\Visual Studio\props`) to projects that depend on `G3D`.

Worked on testing for `OFFdata`.

2021-11-06: 
=====================================================
**Day work time**: 1h30m

**Total work time**: 3h

Finished writing first draft of `OFFdata` class. Set up unit testing, but having some trouble linking `G3D` library in unit testing project. 

2021-07-28: 
=====================================================
**Day work time**: 1h30m

**Total work time**: 1h30m

Drafted report and completed unit cube task.

The unit cube task took longer than expected due to my incorrectly assuming a counterclockwise vertex winding order when the program instead seems to use a clockwise winding order (compounded by some miscellaneous confusions before I realized what the issue was).
