2021-10-20: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Fixed quad blocking bug for perimeter-adjacent Cells.

2021-10-20: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Fixed a bug that was causing crashes (character buffer overflow). One remaining logic error to fix, which is that quad blocking doesn't work correctly for Cells adjacent to cube frame.

2021-10-18: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Restructured code handling Quad mechanics to reduce redundancies.

2021-10-13: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Finished first pass on restructuring code, began debugging starting with some unit testing.

2021-10-12: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Moved Cell class, Direction enum class, and associated code to their own files. Removed DirectionFlag and DirectionFlagSet code.

Continued restructuring &Aacute; refactoring code.

Numbering scheme for Direction enum class is a leftover artifact from previous code structure, which I decided to leave unchanged because aside from looking unusual, it doesn't affect anything.

2021-10-08: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Previously (not logged): started restructuring code to follow new approach to blocking problem (replacing most of the Direction/DirectionFlag code). Next: modify selectDirections.

2021-10-05: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Debugging: Fixed corner-fill issue. Still need to resolve flag blocking issue.

2021-10-04: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Debugging: Program compiles but does not work as intended; cube fills are concentrated in a corner of each face, and there are too many adjacent cube fills (flag blocking not working correctly).

2021-09-15: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Debugging: Cube extension part of code is causing program to crash, presumably due to an uncaught exception. Maybe the while expression?

2021-08-21: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** not tracked

Debugging. `selectDirections()` is causing program to crash, presumably due to an uncaught exception.

2021-08-05: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 1h55m

**Total work time:** 13h50m

Continued working on code for generating the cube's decorative faces.

2021-08-03: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 1h

**Total work time:** 11h55m

Continued working on code for generating the cube's decorative faces.

2021-08-02: Custom scene (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 2h20m

**Total work time:** 10h55m

Completed cube frame and worked on code for generating the cube's decorative faces.

2021-07-29: Custom scene
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 30m

**Total work time:** 8h35m

Started working on custom scene (decorative wooden cube).

2021-07-25: Staircase (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 1h

**Total work time:** 8h05m

Added light source; tweaked parameters for the staircase and light until satisfied. I decided to add *x*- and *z*-translations to the stairstep transforms to produce a wider spiral, which while arguably not as clean-looking, seems to better approximate most real-world staircases.

2021-07-24: Staircase (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 30m

**Total work time:** 7h05m

Stuck with same approach for applying model transforms. Produced some wonky mini staircases, which in hindsight I later realized was because I forgot that positive-z points out of the screen. Whoops.

2021-07-22: Staircase (cont.)
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 2h30m

**Total work time:** 6h35m

Worked on Staircase task.

Most of the "guts" are done by now, just need to calculate the right transforms to generate the full spiral staircase.

For next time: Read through docs on `CoordinateFrame` class, and review either changing basis or rotating about an arbitrary axis.

2021-07-21: Staircase
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 2h30m

**Total work time:** 4h05m

Worked on Staircase task.

Initially looked into and successfully tested using `G3D::TextOutput` to write to disk, but decided to build using `G3D::Any` because the latter approach requires less micromanaging of formatting.

Spent a lot of time trying to build the scene directly from classes like `ArticulatedModel` before inferring that that was probably not really the intended approach. Admittedly, attempting to do so was because I was a little confused why the exercise in using C++ helper functions to write a scene file when the methods available were not much different from simply writing the file manually. I figured being able to procedurally generate objects (such as the winding stairsteps in this task) was a reason, but I got a bit ahead of myself rather than get a working method first before thinking more deeply on it.

2021-07-13: Cornell box
=====================================================
**Day work time:** 1h05m

**Total work time:** 1h35m

Spent some time doing minor placement tweaks so as to closely approximate placements in the actual Cornell box. Unsure if G3D light is able to be configured to match the Cornell box light.

2021-07-12: White cube
=====================================================
**Daily work time:** 30m

**Total work time:** 30m

Worked on white cube task.
