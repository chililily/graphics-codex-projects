## Report

### System overview
`App.cpp` is the main code file for this project. It defines an `App` class that inherits from `G3D::GApp`, which when initialized creates a `G3D::Scene` and renders it to the screen. `Scene` parses files with the extension `.Scene.Any`, which are human-readable scene configuration files.

The code used to generate the Staircase scene file can be found in `staircase.cpp`.

The main program used to generate the custom scene (Pipe Cube) is contained in `pipeCube.cpp`. It makes use of `FaceGrid` and `Cell` classes, and `Direction` enum.

Both Staircase and Pipe Cube tasks use the `G3D::Any` class in conjunction with `G3D::TextInput` (to encode any function invocations) to write the resulting scene configuration files.

### Coordinate system
<!--
Make simple, isometric view, labelled axis-diagrams of the 2D coordinate and 3D coordinate systems (by hand; don't write code for this) used for G3D, and include it in your report. On the 3D coordinate system, show the direction of increase of the yaw, roll, and pitch angles. I would personally either use a Markdeep diagram or draw this on paper and take a photograph.

### Results
**Single white cube**

Rotated 45&deg; about the vertical axis with center at (0m, 0m, -2m).

**Staircase**
Each stairstep is a scaled crate model textured with the `roughcedar` default material. The staircase was procedurally generated by creating a new instance of the stairstep model with a transformed coordinate frame, with *x* and *z* translated according to circular coordinates (modified by a specified radius), *y* decreasing incrementally by stairstep height, and yaw increasing by a specified increment.

**Custom scene: Pipe Cube**
This scene makes use of two models: a scaled crate model, used to construct the frame of the cube; and a non-scaled (i.e. cube) crate model used to create pipe "decorations" on the faces of the cube. Both are textured with the `roughcedar` default material, as in the Staircase task.

The cube frame was constructed by rotating and translating twelve instances of the scaled crate model. The algorithm to decorate each cube face goes as follows:

1. If number of placed cubes exceeds usable space multiplied by fill factor, end. Otherwise, select a random position (cell) on the face until one is found that is available (unoccupied and hasn't been blocked[^1]). Place a cube there.

2. Select a random cardinal direction. If the cell next to the placed cube in that direction is available, continue. Otherwise, check all adjacent cells in cardinal directions until an available one is found. If none are available, return to (1).

3. Place cubes one-by-one in the selected direction until an unavailable cell is hit. Repeat this in the antiparallel direction from the starting cube placed in (2).

[^1] When cubes are placed, nearby cells are checked according to 2X2 groups. If any 2X2 group is found to contain three occupied positions, the remaining cell in the group is blocked. This blocking mechanic ensures a piped design for each cube face.

### Questions & exercises
0. Typesetting exercise
\begin{equation*} \frac{df(x)}{dx} = \lim_{h\rightarrow0} \bigg[ \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} \bigg]\end{equation*}

1. What are the differences between the `Scene*` and `shared_ptr<Scene>` data types in C++? 
    
    In C++, `shared_ptr` is a "smart" pointer class that, in addition to automatically managing its resource, allows co-ownership of a resource.

2. How does G3D know where the scene files are located?

    The `Scene` parser has a member function `setSceneSearchPaths` which can be used to set paths to search for scene files. The parser sets these search paths by default: 
    
    * the current directory (as of the time that the first scene is loaded or `getSceneNames()` is invoked),

    * the paths specified by the `G3D10DATA` environment variable,

    * and the directory containing `System::findDataFile`("`scene/CornellBox-Glossy.scn.any`") if not already included in `G3D10Data`.

3. Why should you put your initialization code into `App::onInit` instead of constructor `App::App`? (Tip: There are many reasons. Try throwing an exception from each, and consider the implications of throwing an exception from a class's constructor.)

4. What is the call chain that invokes `App::onGraphics3D`?

5. Where is the file `cube.obj` stored on the file system? How did the `Scene` parser know to load it from there?

    It is stored in `g3d/data10/common/model/cube`.

6. You can create a material in a scene file from a `Color3`. There are many more ways to construct a G3D material, however. One of these takes separate lambertian, glossy, emissive, and transmissive values. Speculate on why a homogeneous material (i.e., one without a pattern or image) would require four separate "colors" in its specification. 

    Object material can have different absorptive/reflective (etc?) properties that affect how light interacts with it and thus produce different looks, e.g. matte or shiny, (mostly) independently of any patterns on the object surface.
