\begin{equation*} \frac{df(x)}{dx} = \lim_{h\rightarrow0} \bigg[ \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} \bigg]\end{equation*}

1. What are the differences between the `Scene*` and `shared_ptr<Scene>` data types in C++? 
    
    In C++, `shared_ptr` is a "smart" pointer class that, in addition to automatically managing its resource, allows co-ownership of a resource.

2. How does G3D know where the scene files are located?

    The `Scene` parser has a member function `setSceneSearchPaths` which can be used to set paths to search for scene files. The parser sets these search paths by default: 
    
    * the current directory (as of the time that the first scene is loaded or `getSceneNames()` is invoked),

    * the paths specified by the `G3D10DATA` environment variable,

    * and the directory containing `System::findDataFile`("`scene/CornellBox-Glossy.scn.any`") if not already included in `G3D10Data`.

3. Why should you put your initialization code into `App::onInit` instead of constructor `App::App`? (Tip: There are many reasons. Try throwing an exception from each, and consider the implications of throwing an exception from a class's constructor.)

4. What is the call chain that invokes `App::onGraphics3D`?

5. Where is the file `cube.obj` stored on the file system? How did the `Scene` parser know to load it from there?

    It is stored in `g3d/data10/common/model/cube`.

6. You can create a material in a scene file from a `Color3`. There are many more ways to construct a G3D material, however. One of these takes separate lambertian, glossy, emissive, and transmissive values. Speculate on why a homogeneous material (i.e., one without a pattern or image) would require four separate "colors" in its specification. 

    Object material can have different absorptive/reflective (etc?) properties that affect how light interacts with it and thus produce different looks, e.g. matte or shiny, (mostly) independently of any patterns on the object surface.
