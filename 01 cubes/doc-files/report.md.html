## Report

### System overview
`App.cpp` is the main code file for this project. It defines an `App` class that inherits from `G3D::GApp`, which when initialized creates a `G3D::Scene` and renders it to the screen. `Scene` parses files with the extension `.Scene.Any`.

The code used to generate the staircase scene file can be found in `staircase.cpp`. It uses the `G3D::Any` class in conjunction with `G3D::TextInput` (for any function invocations).

### Coordinate system
<!--
Make simple, isometric view, labelled axis-diagrams of the 2D coordinate and 3D coordinate systems (by hand; don't write code for this) used for G3D, and include it in your report. On the 3D coordinate system, show the direction of increase of the yaw, roll, and pitch angles. I would personally either use a Markdeep diagram or draw this on paper and take a photograph. 
-->

### Results
**Single white cube**

Rotated 45&deg; about the vertical axis with center at (0m, 0m, -2m).

**Staircase**
Each stairstep is a scaled crate model textured with the `roughcedar` default material. The staircase was procedurally generated by creating a new instance of the stairstep model with a transformed coordinate frame, with *x* and *z* translated according to circular coordinates (modified by a specified radius), *y* decreasing incrementally by stairstep height, and yaw increasing by a specified increment.

### Questions & exercises

\begin{equation*} \frac{df(x)}{dx} = \lim_{h\rightarrow0} \bigg[ \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} \bigg]\end{equation*}

1. What are the differences between the `Scene*` and `shared_ptr<Scene>` data types in C++? 
    
    In C++, `shared_ptr` is a "smart" pointer class that, in addition to automatically managing its resource, allows co-ownership of a resource.

2. How does G3D know where the scene files are located?

    The `Scene` parser has a member function `setSceneSearchPaths` which can be used to set paths to search for scene files. The parser sets these search paths by default: 
    
    * the current directory (as of the time that the first scene is loaded or `getSceneNames()` is invoked),

    * the paths specified by the `G3D10DATA` environment variable,

    * and the directory containing `System::findDataFile`("`scene/CornellBox-Glossy.scn.any`") if not already included in `G3D10Data`.

3. Why should you put your initialization code into `App::onInit` instead of constructor `App::App`? (Tip: There are many reasons. Try throwing an exception from each, and consider the implications of throwing an exception from a class's constructor.)

4. What is the call chain that invokes `App::onGraphics3D`?

5. Where is the file `cube.obj` stored on the file system? How did the `Scene` parser know to load it from there?

    It is stored in `g3d/data10/common/model/cube`.

6. You can create a material in a scene file from a `Color3`. There are many more ways to construct a G3D material, however. One of these takes separate lambertian, glossy, emissive, and transmissive values. Speculate on why a homogeneous material (i.e., one without a pattern or image) would require four separate "colors" in its specification. 

    Object material can have different absorptive/reflective (etc?) properties that affect how light interacts with it and thus produce different looks, e.g. matte or shiny, (mostly) independently of any patterns on the object surface.
